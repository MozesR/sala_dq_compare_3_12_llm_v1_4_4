# CI (GitHub Actions) for SALA DQ Compare

This workflow runs your **pytest** suite on every push/PR using Python 3.12.

## Install

Add these files to your repository:

```
.github/workflows/pytest.yml
```

Your tests should live in the top-level `tests/` directory (as generated by the v1.4.7 pack).

## Notes
- LLM is disabled in CI (`ENABLE_LLM=false`) to keep runs deterministic.
- If you need extra dependencies, add them to `requirements.txt` or into the workflow's install step.
- Artifacts or coverage can be added later (e.g., `pytest-cov`).
